# Hash tables C

This code is meant to be a suplement to 42's libft (it depends on it).
Compile it together with libft and get a basic implementation of Hash tables in C.

The code itself it's not mine, basically is just an adaptation from-> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/hash-table-in-c-plus-plus

DEPRECATED

Moved all data structures in C to new [repo](https://github.com/CodinaFJ/data_structures_C)
