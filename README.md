# Hash tables C

This code is meant to be a suplement to 42's libft (it depends on it).
Compile it together with libft and get a basic implementation of Hash tables in C.

The code itself it's not mine, basically is just an adaptation from-> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/hash-table-in-c-plus-plus

### Coming soon
- A proper explanation
- Makefiles
- Dependencies
- Better hashing
- Maybe I implement a more efficient collision handling

### Known issues

- I am using printf because ft_printf was bugging on windows. Will look into that.
