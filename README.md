# Hash tables C

This code is meant to be a suplement to 42's libft (it depends on it).
Compile it together with libft and get a basic implementation of Hash tables in C.

Coming soon: a proper explanation, makefiles, dependencies...

### Known issues

- I am using printf because ft_printf was bugging on windows. Will look into that.
